I wanted to write this article because learning to _sell_ is probably the best investment I made.

So this was my situation:

It is 2024, and tech hiring is not as good as it were in 2020

I was making 2,500 USD per month, but that wasn't enough for me, I wanted to be able to make more money.

So I needed to create businesses in order to generate money.

Using my software abilities, I was able to create startups and sell them, and with my mathematical knowledge, I was able to create really amazing stuff.

Or so I thought.

The software was the easy part.

The hard part was convincing people to buy my product at first.

Even though the product was great, there was no too much people who knew about it.

How I was supposed to sell my services or saas without users?

## Entering Marketing and Sales

I recommend a book really good called 100M Leads by Alex Hormozi, one of the entrepreneurs I truly look up to.

He talked about giving something so good for free that people question how your paid product looks like.

I made my marketing product focused.

If the product was good, then the rest of the users will come once they start knowing about it.
