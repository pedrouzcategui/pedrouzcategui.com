It always have been an objective of mine to make 100k per year.

I want to document this journey of how much it takes to make 100k by software programming.

## Objective: Get a remote 100k job as a Software Engineer before 2024 ends by:

### 1. Building a project each day

### 2. Reading a book each week

### 3. Building a business each month

### 4. Sharing my progress in Twitter

I already have some experience on my belt, I started coding on September 16th, 2019.

I got my first programming gig on January 11th, 2020.

However, I haven't growed more in terms of being a **pro**.

This is my current knowledge/tech stack:

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Python, C, C++, Go, PHP.
- **Web Frameworks:** Tailwind.css, React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Selenium, Laravel.
- **DevOps:** Git/Github, Docker.
- **Other Thingies**: Redux.js, React Query, Storybook, Jest
- **Automation Tools:** Zapier, Make, Pabbly, PyAutoGui, Selenium.

However, there is something I learned this year, and that's that **I don't want to make websites for a living.**

I think I'm born for something more challenging than websites.

I recently fell in love with Mathematics, I never was a straight A+ student... but after my sister graduation from Uni, something clicked inside me.

I wanted to be one of the best people in mathematics and logic overall.

So I started studying mathematics all over again, starting from Trigonometry, Radicals, and Logarithms, probably my 3 biggest weaknesses.

This upcoming year; 2024; I'll be learning the following things (not specific order):

1. **Linux:** I noticed that I'm really weak at webservers and configuration, this is vital to learn.
2. **Docker:** I believe this is mandatory.
3. **Sockets & Network Protocols:** I'm just genuinely curious about this.
4. **Low Level Programming (with C/C++):** [I'll be following this list of projects](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#cc)
5. **Math (College Math 2 to 5):** I want to understand AI, so I need solid Math foundations.
6. **Advanced CSS + Animations:** The only way I'll be able to be better than the competition, is by learning more techniques.

Happy Christmas!

My goals for this next year are:

1. Get a 5k job or a business to make 5k per month.
2. Take seriously my fitness, food and health.
3. Learn to Read, Write, Speak and Understand French.
4. Learn Math from 1 to 5.
5. Finish my T.S.U and continue with the rest of Engineering online in other university.

Other non-specific goals are

- Apply for the Diversity Visa Lottery on May 4th.
- Buy an apartment or probably just invest that in courses so I can make more money
